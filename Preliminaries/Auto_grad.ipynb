    "Calculating derivatives is the crucial step in all the optimization algorithms that we will use to train deep networks. While the calculations are straightforward, working them out by hand can be tedious and error-prone, and these issues only grow as our models become more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately all modern deep learning frameworks take this work off our plates by offering automatic differentiation (often shortened to autograd). As we pass data through each successive function, the framework builds a computational graph that tracks how each value depends on others. To calculate derivatives, automatic differentiation works backwards through this graph applying the chain rule. The computational algorithm for applying the chain rule in this fashion is called backpropagation."

    "So far we reviewed cases where the path from input to output was well defined via a function such as z = x * x * x. Programming offers us a lot more freedom in how we compute results. For instance, we can make them depend on auxiliary variables or condition choices on intermediate results. One benefit of using automatic differentiation is that even if building the computational graph of a function required passing through a maze of Python control flow (e.g., conditionals, loops, and arbitrary function calls), we can still calculate the gradient of the resulting variable. To illustrate this, consider the following code snippet where the number of iterations of the while loop and the evaluation of the if statement both depend on the value of the input a"
