    "The intuition behind summing the derivatives in the chain rule (i.e., \\( \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_i} = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u_j} \\frac{\\partial u_j}{\\partial x_i} \\)) comes from how multivariate functions depend on each other, especially when there are intermediate variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the intuition:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Multivariate functions are interdependent**:\n",
    "   In deep learning or multivariate calculus, often we are dealing with functions of many variables. For example, if you have a function \\( y = f(u_1, u_2, \\ldots, u_m) \\) where each \\( u_j \\) is in turn a function of \\( \\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n] \\), then \\( y \\) is indirectly affected by \\( \\mathbf{x} \\) through the intermediate variables \\( u_1, u_2, \\ldots, u_m \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "   So, to compute how \\( y \\) changes when we change just one of the input variables \\( x_i \\), we need to understand how each of these intermediate variables \\( u_j \\) changes with respect to \\( x_i \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **How each intermediate variable depends on \\( x_i \\)**:\n",
    "   Each \\( u_j \\) is a function of the inputs \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n \\). Thus, when we change \\( x_i \\), each intermediate variable \\( u_j \\) will also change in some way (because \\( u_j \\) depends on \\( x_i \\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "   So, we need to compute how much \\( u_j \\) changes with respect to \\( x_i \\), i.e., the partial derivative \\( \\frac{\\partial u_j}{\\partial x_i} \\). This tells us how much each intermediate variable contributes to the change in \\( y \\) when we change \\( x_i \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **How \\( y \\) depends on each \\( u_j \\)**:\n",
    "   Next, we need to understand how much \\( y \\) changes with respect to each of the intermediate variables \\( u_j \\). This is simply the partial derivative \\( \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u_j} \\), which tells us how sensitive \\( y \\) is to a change in each \\( u_j \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Combining the effects**:\n",
    "   Now, to find how much \\( y \\) changes with respect to \\( x_i \\), we combine these two effects:\n",
    "   - The effect of changing \\( x_i \\) on \\( u_j \\), which is \\( \\frac{\\partial u_j}{\\partial x_i} \\).\n",
    "   - The effect of changing \\( u_j \\) on \\( y \\), which is \\( \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u_j} \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "   Since \\( y \\) depends on all the intermediate variables, we sum the contributions from all the \\( u_j \\)'s, which leads to the total derivative:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_i} = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u_j} \\frac{\\partial u_j}{\\partial x_i}\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "   Each term \\( \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u_j} \\frac{\\partial u_j}{\\partial x_i} \\) represents how much \\( y \\) changes due to a change in \\( x_i \\), passing through the intermediate variable \\( u_j \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Why sum the contributions?**\n",
    "   The sum appears because each intermediate variable \\( u_j \\) can influence \\( y \\), and each intermediate variable \\( u_j \\) is influenced by \\( x_i \\). So, we need to add the total influence from all intermediate variables to compute the total influence of \\( x_i \\) on \\( y \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "   Think of it like this: If you have several \"paths\" through which a change in \\( x_i \\) can affect \\( y \\) (each path going through a different \\( u_j \\)), you need to account for each of these paths. The sum represents the total effect of all those paths combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "   Imagine a simple case where \\( y = f(u_1, u_2) \\), and \\( u_1 = g_1(x_1, x_2) \\) and \\( u_2 = g_2(x_1, x_2) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - First, you compute how \\( y \\) changes with respect to \\( u_1 \\) and \\( u_2 \\): \\( \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u_1} \\) and \\( \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u_2} \\).\n",
    "   - Then, compute how eac\n"
